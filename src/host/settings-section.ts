/**
 * Attaching this plugin's settings section to the harness settings provider.
 *
 * Harness 0.1.1-rc.2 and earlier exported two free helpers from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings` for
 * this, `installSettingsSection` and `settingsNamespace`. Current harnesses removed both: the same
 * wiring is the provider's own `settings.installSection(owner, ns, schema, entry, hooks)`, reached
 * through `ctx.inject(['settings'], …)`. Importing the old helpers by name fails to link on a
 * current install, so the plugin carries these two small equivalents instead of depending on a
 * compatibility shim that only exists on a development machine.
 *
 * Injecting `settings` rather than requiring it keeps the plugin loadable in a deployment that
 * mounts no settings provider: the section simply never attaches, and the composition entry the
 * plugin was configured with stays the source.
 * @module @achasoft/dsh-worktree/host/settings-section
